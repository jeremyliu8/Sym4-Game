Sym4-Game
=========

Liu, Jeremy. 2014

This is a 4x4 Sudoku game that includes 4 different game Sets:
1,2,3,4
A,B,C,D
P,Q,R,S
D,H,S,C (cards)

Included:
.jar file to run Sym4Game
.java file to view all code and comments
.class files to run the .java file

Features:
- Keeps track of how many moves you make and scores you based on the amount of moves taken (can be negative, so don't mess up!)
- Keeps track of how many games you have played as well as your total score from all games
- Randomly generates a new board after every game, or if you press "New Game"
- Easy interface: Click the number (or letter) you want to put on the board, and simply click on the square to put it there.
- Check your progress by clicking "Done!"

I created all code from the graphical user interface to the back-end board generator and checker.

This was my term project for CS320 - Data structures at Azusa Pacific University
